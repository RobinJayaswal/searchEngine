## Robin Jayaswal, Kyle Dotterrer, May 2016

### **Overview**
The indexer is a subsystem of TSE. Indexer builds an inverted index data 
structure from a collection of text files output by the crawling process. These
files are located in the page directory passed to the indexer. Once all of the
files have been scanned and the directory has been built, indexer write the 
data structure to a file with a user-provided name in a specific format. See
DESIGN for additional information.
