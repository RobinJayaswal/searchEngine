## Robin Jayaswal, Kyle Dotterrer, May 2016

### **Project Overview**
The Tiny Search Engine (hereafter referred to as TSE) is a basic, modular 
search engine program capabale of crawling, indexing, and querying webpages 
internal to the Dartmouth CS Department server. 

### **Compilation**
Compilation of all three project subsystems can be completed simultaneous by
a single call to _make_ in the top-level tse/ directory. Here, _make_ also has
the effect of building the _cs50ds_ and _common_ libraries utilized by all three
of the subsystems. The subsystems may also be compiled individually by calling
_make_ in each of their respective subdirectories. 

### **Subsystems**

#### Crawler

#### Indexer

#### Querier
