TESTING for bag module
Kyle Dotterrer, April 2016
***********************************************************

I created a test program file, bagtest.c, to test the 
functionality of the bag module. I compiled this program
with the inclusion of the bag module header file and 
provided the module's object file (bag.o) to the linker. 

Bag Module Tests:
(module functionalities verified in bagtest program)
   
  Sequence 1:
   > I tested creation of a new bag data structure with
     a delete function that deletes statically-allocated
     data, meaning that the delete function body is empty.

   > I tested insertions into this bag structure

   > I tested extractions from this bag structure, printing
     the returned data to ensure that it matched what was
     inserted initially

   > I tested extraction from an empty bag structure and 
     verified that the correct value was returned: a NULL
     pointer

   > I tested deletion of an empty bag structure that was 
     created to hold statically allocated data

  Sequence 2:
   > I tested creation of a new bag data structure with
     a delete function that deletes dynamically-allocated
     data, meaning that the delete function frees the input
     variable

   > I tested insertion of dynamically-allocated strings
     into this bag structure

   > I tested extraction from this bag, verifying that the 
   	 expected data was returned by printing the result

   > I tested deletion of a non-empty bag that still held
     dynamically allocated data, meaning that the delete 
     function would have to be called to delete the data
     contained within the bag

  Sequence 3:
   > I tested extraction from an invalid (NULL) bag
     structure and verified that the correct value was
     returned: a NULL pointer

Error Statuses:
  0 - success
  1 - struct creation error

Compilation of Test Program:
(makefile included in module directory)

    make
