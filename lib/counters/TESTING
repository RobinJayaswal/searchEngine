TESTING for 'counters' module
Kyle Dotterrer, April 2016
***********************************************************

I wrote a testing program file, counterstest.c, 
to verify the functionality of the counters module. 
I compiled this test program by including the header 
file for the counters module and including the module 
object file (counters.o) in the linking process.

Counters Module Tests:
(module functionalities verified in counterstest program)

	Sequence 1:
		> I tested the creation of a new counters struct
		  and verified that the creation was successful

		> I tested the addition of integer values to 
		  the created counters

		> I tested the addition of duplicate values to the
		  created counters

		> I verified that the additions worked correctly 
		  by then calling the get function and displaying
		  the output 

		> I tested the response of the counters get
		  function when a value that was not inserted was
		  passed as the argument, and verified that the 
		  returned value was the expected (0)

		> I tested deletion of the counters with the 
		  delete function

	Sequence 2:
		> I tested the operation of the counters get
		  function when it was invoked on an invalid
		  counters structure

		> I printed the results of this test to verify 
		  that the expected value (0) was returned by the 
		  function call

Error statuses:
	0 - success
	1 - structure creation error

Compilation of Test Program:
(makefile included in module directory)
	
	make
